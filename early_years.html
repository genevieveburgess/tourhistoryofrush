	<p> This is the first tour for Rush; it went from September 18th, 1968 to October 27th, 1973. 
	At the time the band consisted of Alex Lifeson on Guitar, Geddy Lee on Bass, and John Rutsey on Drums. 
	Many of the shows were played at local churches, schools, pubs, or cafes around the Toronto area. 
	The picture in the back of the image was the band playing at the Waterloo Lutheran University. The 
	furthest show from home was in Thunder Bay, Ontario.</p>
